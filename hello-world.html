<!--
Import Polymer, this library is only used for
building custom elements.

Polymer is a Google library (suggar sintaxe library)
to build custom elements on most modern browsers.

PS: To just load custom-elements, we can use the
webcomponentsjs-lite, a lot smaller

The link tag with "import" is a new draft, not supported on
**all browsers**, but there is polyfills to the not
*supported browsers.
-->
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
<dom-module id="hello-world">
  <template>
    <h2>{{message}}</h2>
  </template>
  <script>
    /*
    Lets explain, dom-module is a new native tag in all
    browsers that supports shadow-dom and custom-elements
    this let you to define the element using native HTML.

    template tag is a also native tag for custom-elements.
    to know all supported browsers look at: https://www.chromestatus.com/features/4642138092470272
    template define the skeleton of your element,
    there is support to binding properties, with {{}},
    that means you can just set the property in your javascript
    or using tag attributes, and vuala, the changes are stamped
    in your HTML code magically (not =P).
     */
    Polymer({
      /*
        `is` matches dom-module id, so Polymer can know
        about dom-module
       */
      is: 'hello-world',
      properties: {
        message: String
      }
    });
  </script>
</dom-module>
